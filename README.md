# Welcome to Workbook 00!

Similar to what you did in **Lesson 00**, please click the big green "Code" button and click "Open in GitHub Desktop". If you are on Windows or macOS, then you should see "Open in GitHub Desktop" under the "Code" button. If you are on Linux, then you will have to copy/paste the HTTPS URL into GitHub Desktop.

When you clone it, be sure to clone the repo to your "pycode" directory.

Once you have cloned this repo, head over to the Workbook 00 Submission repository, located here:
